DungeonBlog

DungeonBlog is a barebones static blog generator. It takes a directory
containing specially formatted text files (markdown) as input, and outputs a
directory containing formatted HTML.

Why use DungeonBlog?

This tool was originally for my own personal blog, hosted on my webserver
(https://jossco.de). It is mostly a custom-tailored solution to my own specific
needs and personal taste (no JS, minimal content, maximum browser support), it
does not look pretty by default and lacks many features usually considered to be
standard by many people.

Why the name?

Of course, the "Dungeon" in the name is a reference to the popular TTRPG
"Dungeons and Dragons". How could it possibly refer to anything else? There is
no way the creator thought of anything else when coming up with the name...
